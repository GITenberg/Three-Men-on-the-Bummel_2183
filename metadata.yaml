description: "Three Men on the Bummel (also known as Three Men on Wheels) is a humorous\
  \ novel by Jerome K. Jerome. It was published in 1900, eleven years after his most\
  \ famous work, Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog).\nThe sequel brings\
  \ back the three companions who figured in Three Men in a Boat, this time on a bicycle\
  \ tour through the German Black Forest. D. C. Browning's introduction to the 1957\
  \ Everyman's edition says \"Like most sequels, it has been compared unfavourably\
  \ with its parent story, but it was only a little less celebrated than Three Men\
  \ in a Boat and was for long used as a school book in Germany.\"[1] Jeremy Nicholas\
  \ of the Jerome K. Jerome Society regards it as a \"comic masterpiece\" containing\
  \ \"set pieces\" as funny or funnier than those in its predecessor, but, taken as\
  \ a whole, not as satisfying due to the lack of as strong a unifying thread.[2]\n\
